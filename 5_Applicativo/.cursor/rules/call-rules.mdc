# Introduction 

The app "calls" handles inbound and outbound calls to and from the phone number associated with an assistant.

The calls are handled by Twilio and the app receives webhooks from Twilio to notify the app of call events.

We must use websockets to handle the real-time events from Twilio, to have
real time communication between the app and the call.

An example of the websocket communication is provided in the file `twilio_transcriber.py` and the file `main.py` shows how to use the websocket,
but the problem is that it doesnt use socketio, we will need that.


## Assistant components

The assistant is composed of several components:

1. The assistant brain (llm), `libs/assistant/assistant_llm.py`
2. The assistant tts, `libs/assistant/text_to_speech.py`
3. The assistant stt, `libs/assistant/speech_to_text.py`

## Assistant voice stream implementation

Use `app/assistants/socket_events.py` as an example of how to implement the communication between the assistant and the call.


## Example of the non technical communication

The user calls our phone number, and the call is answered by the assistant.

The assistant starts to talk to the user, and the user starts to talk to the assistant.

The assistant listens to the user, and the user listens to the assistant.

If the user says something and the assistant is talking, the assistant will stop talking.
